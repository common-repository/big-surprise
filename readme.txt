== Description ==

<strong>`Big Surprise`</strong> is a small `Wordpress Plugin` which is writed with a simple language. With this plugin you can not make big big things but however it`s ideal for a sweety beginning. The cause of not be beta version is that the possibility of developing this sweety thing being spent a little time.

Now, lets come to small explanation, you can want to make a surprise one of your members and want to separate the one edge of the page with a private thing belonging to him/her. (For the present I chose this private thing as a picture, a picture only she can see!) If you want that, you can make real that with this small thing... The thing what you have to make is only to arrange plugin the name of the person you see him/her as `lucky` and the other information opening with a simple organizer like notepad, notepad ++ or others webmasters program. When the procedure of organizer is done and the plugin is actuated, a sentence like  `Big Surprise :)`  appears on the web page. When the  `lucky`  person entry, this sentence which can seen by everyone changes but in a way that only she/he can see. Thus you can make a tiny surprise with a bit of curiosity and waiting. Certainly, everything isnt limited like that! Think of the space which have to used. You can make drawing on the web page and explain the results like that. You can put a small note and show someone diversity when the person who is desired entries for meeting with this plugin.
